Importing decks from Quizlet into Anki is very simple. Here's how:

## Steps to Import

1. With **Anki** open, navigate to the toolbar
2. Go to `Tools > Add-ons`
3. Click `Get Add-ons`
4. Paste `538351043` and hit OK (This installs the Quizlet Importer add-on)
5. Next, Restart **Anki**
6. Go to the Quizlet deck you want to import
7. Copy the link, then go to `Tools > Import from Quizlet`
8. Paste the Quizlet link, hit OK, and you're all done.

## Common Problems

Sometimes, when importing, the cards may be back to front instead of front to back. In order to fix this, you can select all the cards in the imported deck. Then, right-click and select `Change Note Type`. Then, under `Fields`, change the first value of "front" to "back".
